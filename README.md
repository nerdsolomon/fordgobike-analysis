# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration

## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary Of Findings

In the exploration, i find out that bike sharing does have and effect on both the time duration of a race and the distance traveled by the user. 
Even though the Customer user travelled longer distanced than the Subscriber user by a few thousand meters, the Subscriber spend lesser time duration reaching the end point. 
Also, i notice that none of the Customer user shared their bike through out their trips, unlike the Subscriber users which have a percentage share bike during their race.

## Key Insights For The Presentation

For the presentation, i focused on the effect of bike sharing on race duration and distance travelled. I started by introducing the time duration variable which i've earlier converted from seconds to minutes format, followed by it's visualization.

After that, i introduced the Distance variable distribution which i created in the exploration using the start and end longitude and latitude values, which was followed by it's visualisation.

Then i introduced two clear different plots of where i plotted the two categorical variables; bike_share_for_all_trip and user_type, to both race duration and race distance.
